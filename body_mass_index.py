'''Body mass index is calculated by dividing body weight by the square of height. (kg/mÂ²)
If the result is below 18.5 kg/m^2, means you'rebelow ideal weight (low weight)
If the result is between 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m^2, means you're ideal weight (normal weight)
If the result is between 25 to 29.9 kg/m^2, means you're above ideal weight (overweight)
If the result is between 30 to 39.9 kg/m^2, means you're too much above ideal weight (obesity)
If the result is above 40 kg/m^2, means you're above ideal weight extremely (extremely obese)'''
